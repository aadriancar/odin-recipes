        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This crispy fried chicken recipe begins by making the breading mixture with flour, paprika, salt, and pepper, 
        which is placed in a zip-top bag for easy shaking and mixing. The chicken is then dredged in buttermilk, ensuring 
        itâ€™s fully coated, before being transferred to the flour mixture. The chicken is shaken well in the bag to coat 
        it evenly and then placed on a baking sheet to allow the coating to set into a paste-like texture.</p>
        <p>Next, the chicken is fried in hot oil in a skillet. First, the chicken is browned on both sides, then the heat 
        is reduced, and the skillet is covered to cook the chicken through for about 30 minutes. After removing the cover, 
        the heat is increased again to make the chicken extra crispy. Finally, the fried chicken is drained on paper
        towels to remove excess oil, resulting in a golden, crispy exterior with a juicy interior.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Four-pound whole chicken OR four pounds of any type of chicken</li>
            <li>Buttermilk</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Paprika</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
            <li>Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour 
            you use). Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).</li>
            <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag 
            and shake to coat well.</li>
            <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET 
            SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!</li>
            <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.</li>
            <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.</li>
            <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through 
            but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</li>
            <li>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a 
            few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</li>
        </ol>
