        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This crispy fried chicken recipe begins by making the breading mixture with flour, paprika, salt, and pepper, 
        which is placed in a zip-top bag for easy shaking and mixing. The chicken is then dredged in buttermilk, ensuring 
        itâ€™s fully coated, before being transferred to the flour mixture. The chicken is shaken well in the bag to coat 
        it evenly and then placed on a baking sheet to allow the coating to set into a paste-like texture.</p>
        <p>Next, the chicken is fried in hot oil in a skillet. First, the chicken is browned on both sides, then the heat 
        is reduced, and the skillet is covered to cook the chicken through for about 30 minutes. After removing the cover, 
        the heat is increased again to make the chicken extra crispy. Finally, the fried chicken is drained on paper
        towels to remove excess oil, resulting in a golden, crispy exterior with a juicy interior.</p>
