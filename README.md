# Odin Recipes Project

Hello! I am currently a high school senior, following through the Foundations Course in The Odin Project. About a little less than half way through the course, I was assigned to make a "Recipes" project which consisted of a webpage that provided links to other webpages that contained information about various recipes. In this project, I was to create each webpage using strictly HTML.

### What I Learned

Throughout the early stages of this course, I have learned and applied the basics of HTML and Git. Through this project, I have shown proficiency in writing text, headers, lists, links, and images in HTML. Additionally, I have demonstrated an understanding in using and maintaining Git throughout the process of working on this project.
